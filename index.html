        <h3>What is Web Design?</h3>
        <p>Web design is the process of creating the visual aesthetics and user experience of a website. It involves planning, conceptualizing, and arranging content intended for the Internet. Modern web design goes beyond just how things look (aesthetics) to include how things work (functionality). Good web design is about finding the perfect balance between form and function. It uses typography, color, images, and layout to create an engaging online experience that serves the website's purpose while providing value to visitors.</p>

        <h3>What is Web Development?</h3>
        <p>Web development refers to the building and maintenance of websites. It's the work that happens behind the scenes to make a website look great, work fast, and perform well with a seamless user experience. Web developers accomplish this by using a variety of coding languages and frameworks. The languages they use depend on the type of task they're performing and the platforms they're working on.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Key Distinction:</strong> While web design focuses on what users see on their screens, web development focuses on the underlying code that makes websites function.</p>
